	* phtml.cl: output keyword symbols in upper case when phtml.cl is compiled in
	            :CASE-INSENSITIVE-UPPER lisp. 
	            runtime raw mode (<style>,<script>) change to be case insensitive

2000-05-12 Steve Jacobson <sdj>

	* phtml-test.cl: added tests to check things like <b><i>bold and italic</b>just italic</i>
	* phtml.cl: accept all characters in undelimited attribute values except for whitespance
	              and >
	            handle "interleved" character style tags in a sensible way

2000-05-09 Steve Jacobson <sdj>

	* phtml-test.cl: added STYLE test
	* phtml.cl: replaced declaim optimization with declarations in each function
	            allow / in undelimited attribute value
	            don't treat :comment as special, but treat :style as special "raw" mode

        phtml.cl

	* add :callback-only keyword to parse-html methods and change
	  code to speed processing when set to non-nil

	phtml-test.cl

	* complete transition to using test harness
	* add :callback-only tests and callback test with nested elements
	
2000-04-19  Steve Jacobson <sdj>

	phtml.cl:

	* take out stale comments
	* use net.html.parser package - exported symbols are:
	      parse-html element-callback
	* phtml methods renamed parse-html
	* setf'able element-callback method registers function to be invoked
	  with parse tree output that starts with specified HTML tag
	* support raw mode in <comment> and <script> tags
	* parse incorrect HTML in a manner that reflects writer's intentions:
	    <a href=mailto:lmcelroy@performigence.com>lmcelroy@performigence.com</a>
	    is processed as if it read:
            <a href="mailto:lmcelroy@performigence.com">lmcelroy@performigence.com</a>
	* :colgroup was incorrectly identified as a tag that can't have a body
	* fixes resulting from test suite

	phtml-test.cl:

	* reflect above package and symbol changes
	* use test harness
	* add tests for element-callback methods
	* user::testit invokes test suite
	

2000-03-28  Steve Jacobson <sdj>

	* take out comments that are no longer relevant
	* :object shouldn't have tag-no-end property
	* :dd also closes :dt
	* first *if clause in close-off-tags has to check that candidate
	  tag may close off more than just the current tag

	* New file: phtml-test.cl - test by:
	  (lhtml-equal (phtml *test-string*) *expected-result*)

2000-03-28  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	*  add stream when user supplied read-sequence function is called

2000-03-23  Steve Jacobson <sdj>

	* added state-rawdata lexer state, which can be triggered
	  by calling parser to put lexer in mode where subsequent text
	  is gobbled up into ocdata until the specified delimiter is seen

	* added read-sequence-func arg to next token, so user can 
	  optionally supply function to fetch next sequence of chars;
	  turned phtml stream method into internal function so method args
	  don't change - user who wishes to supply read-sequence-func can
	  either invoke phtml-internal or add a method that calls 
	  phtml-internal with custome read-sequence-func argument

	* added knowledge to parser to reduce number of pcdata outputs that
	  only contain whitespace

	* added large number of tag-auto-close and some tag-auto-close-stop
	  properties to html symbols so parser properly handles all tags
	  with optional end tags
