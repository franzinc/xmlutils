	* take out comments that are no longer relevant
	* :object shouldn't have tag-no-end property
	* :dd also closes :dt
	* first *if clause in close-off-tags has to check that candidate
	  tag may close off more than just the current tag

	* New file: phtml-test.cl - test by:
	  (lhtml-equal (phtml *test-string*) *expected-result*)

	*  add stream when user supplied read-sequence function is called

	* added state-rawdata lexer state, which can be triggered
	  by calling parser to put lexer in mode where subsequent text
	  is gobbled up into ocdata until the specified delimiter is seen

	* added read-sequence-func arg to next token, so user can 
	  optionally supply function to fetch next sequence of chars;
	  turned phtml stream method into internal function so method args
	  don't change - user who wishes to supply read-sequence-func can
	  either invoke phtml-internal or add a method that calls 
	  phtml-internal with custome read-sequence-func argument

	* added knowledge to parser to reduce number of pcdata outputs that
	  only contain whitespace

	* added large number of tag-auto-close and some tag-auto-close-stop
	  properties to html symbols so parser properly handles all tags
	  with optional end tags
